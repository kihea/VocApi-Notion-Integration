# Notion Integration Tool
Uses vocabulary.com third-party API to grab account lists and words, then uses Rapid API to get detailed information about each word. Words are then synced to a notion database.

! Make sure to replace relevant information in app.js such as tokens and login for the program to work.
May be outdated, API could have changed. No longer updating/maintaining the project.
